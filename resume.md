<h4 style="text-align: center;">I turn 'what if' into 'what is'... with a little help from my product teams.</h4>

As both a product leader and individual contributor, I bring a maturity acquired in the trenches. My ability to rapidly internalize and comprehend complex processes, strategically communicate critical insights to C-level leadership with precision, navigate risk and regulatory demands, mentor junior team members, and manage the entire product process from zero to production, makes me well-suited to manage next-generation product initiatives and lead the teams that deliver them.
