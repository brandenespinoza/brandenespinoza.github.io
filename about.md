# Thanks for Stopping By!
Hi, I'm Branden Espinoza – a dedicated family man, a passionate Bitcoin evangelist, and an experienced leader in the fintech space. With a unique blend of skills spanning traditional finance and digital assets, I've had the privilege of leading product teams that turn fintech visions into market realities.

## Professional Journey
My career has taken me through the intricate worlds of both traditional finance and the digital asset ecosystem. At firms like American Express FX and Truist, I honed my expertise in regulatory compliance, ensuring financial services are both innovative and compliant. My journey then led me to the cutting edge of decentralized finance at Block.one and Bullish.com, where I contributed to the growth of L1s, zero-to-one pre-seed apps, and exchanges.

My goal has always been to work with forward-thinking teams that are eager to shape the future.

## Personal Passions
When I’m not immersed in the world of fintech, you’ll find me enjoying the simpler pleasures of life. As a family man, my greatest joy comes from spending quality time with my loved ones. I also indulge in a few quirky passions – whether it’s grooving to some tacky troprock, getting lost in a heavy book, or perfecting the art of smoked meats.

## My Philosophy
I believe in the power of startups to disrupt and innovate, and I’m always eager to support and lead teams that share this belief. I’m startup-friendly and thrive in environments where creativity and agility are valued. My approach is always hands-on, ensuring that ideas don’t just remain on paper but become impactful market realities.  My study of Austrian economics and praxeology shapes my understanding of human behavior and decision-making, which in turn influences my approach to product development and market strategy. I’m passionate about integrating these principles into my work, fostering environments where ethical practices and sound economic theories drive success. I also practice a deep and abiding faith which guides my personal and professional life. 

## Let's Connect
I’m always open to new opportunities and connections. If you’re looking for someone who combines a deep understanding of both traditional finance and digital assets (especially bitcoin) with a personal touch, let’s talk. Looking forward to connecting with you!
