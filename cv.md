<h4 style="text-align: center;">I take good product ideas, make them great, and lead the teams that turn them into successful market solutions.</h4>

As a product leader and individual contributor, I bring a maturity acquired in the trenches. My ability to gain product vision buy-in from key stakeholders, communicate with c-level leadership, navigate risk and regulatory compliance demands, and mentor junior team members make me well-suited to manage next-generation product initiatives and lead the teams that deliver them.
