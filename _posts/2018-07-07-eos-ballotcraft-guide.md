lead_text: "<strong>REMIT: </strong>To provide an on-chain mechanism for product managers and developers to propose changes or upgrades to the EOSIO core software and assess community support. This project defined the appropriate syntax and workflow that product managers, developers, and token holders should use to submit proposals. Leveraging an on-chain referendum system embodied the original DAO-like vision for EOS."
