lead_text: "<strong>REMIT: </strong>To regularize the best practices of proposal submissions of users in the EOS ecosystem, I founded and led the EOS Ballotcraft Working group.  This project required defining the appropriate syntax when token holder submitted proposals to the network at large. The original vision for EOS was for it to function as a DAO, and this BallotCraft guide, leveraging a smart contract driven on-chain referendum system, constituted a real world beta version of that vision."
