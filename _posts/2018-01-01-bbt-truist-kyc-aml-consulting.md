lead_text: "<strong>REMIT: </strong>To address deficiencies in BB&T Bankâ€™s BSA/AML compliance program as required by a 2017 FDIC consent order, and to provide training to product teams, the Financial Intelligence Unit, and other key stakeholders. I refined the content, certified the learners, and implemented a system for delivery and certification tracking. The final product received FDIC approval, leading to the lifting of the consent order."
